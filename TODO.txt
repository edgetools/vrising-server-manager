(in-progress) TODO^: overhaul DoCommands to use process monitors /  watchers
      - rather than commands, launch a process monitor
      - runs a loop, sleeps every second, then checks the command queue
      - if the command queue goes empty and the server is stopped, stop the process monitor
      - if the process monitor isn't started when a command is issued, start the process monitor
      - if a command is in the queue (file), pulls it off the top, processes it, then writes the removal once it finishes
      - kill commands for update/start will still directly target the underlying process
      - stop commands will issue a command in the commandqueue
      - can also stop additional commands in the queue by disabling the server
      TODO: wait for commands to finish (start to start, stop to exit, update to exit) and grab exit codes

TODO: add a Wait-VRisingServer (vrwait) command
      - checks if a command is running
      - throws error if the current or last command error'd
      - waits for command to finish
      - waits for certain conditions based on last command
      - Start
        - waits until IsRunning()
      - Stop
        - waits until IsStopped()

TODO(?): output server object on each command for chaining, e.g.:
         - vrget foo | vrsay "stopping server for update" | vrstop | vrwait | vrupdate | vrwait | vrstart | vrwait | vrannounce "server update complete"
